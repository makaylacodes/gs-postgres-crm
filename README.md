# Customer Relationship Management Tool

This CRM gives small business owners a way to manage and filter customer data. There is also a feature to automate data (sending emails, payment reminders, etc.). Some examples of famous CRMs are Hubspot, Salesforce, and Oracle

CRMs can be expensive and often have features irrelevant to the owner's business. This CRM allows business owners to customize how they store data so they can save on costs and focus on the data that really matters.

Platform Functionality :
   1. Read data from database
   2. Write data to database
   3. Refund processing with Stripe API
   4. Mass personalized emails to specific groups of customers using Mail API.
   5. Sort data in a visual way, using dynamic graphs and charts.

An application programming interface or API is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. They are behind most apps that we use on a daily basis, which is a Mail API and a Stripe API were used for this project. It saves time when building custom applications. More APIs can be added to this dashboard, it just depends on the users needs.

Huge credit to Ania Kubów and her FreeCodeCamp tutorial. She didn't just show me how to build a CRM, she also explained what she was doing every step of the way, with every change she made. I truly gained a better understanding of how to work with databases. I have made several changes to the project in order to make it my own.
